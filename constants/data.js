      `Developing solution has been my passion since my high school time, still remember my first hello world using c++ with Turbo C++ editor not working at first time make me challanged. And after my first hello world worked i'm so very happy and that's what i liked about developing program`,
      `My journey was not a smooth one, but finally in 2019 i got my chance to prove myself what i'm made of. From developing full-stack accounting system to develop marketplace Treetan from there i choose backend development for my focus `,
      `My first project was in school was using vb.net and then c#, and i continue to learning those two for 2 years. The first production code i write is using Native PHP. TailwindCSS, Bootstrap for my frontend and Laravel is my current primary weapon to tackle problem`
